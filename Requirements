discord.py>=2.0.1
colorama>=0.4.6

Explanation

discord.py>=2.0.1: This line ensures the installation of the Discord.py library, crucial for interacting with the Discord API. The >=2.0.1 part specifies that version 2.0.1 or any newer version is acceptable.
colorama>=0.4.6: This line handles the installation of the colorama library, which is used for adding color to the console output (e.g., the banner and messages). Again, >=0.4.6 allows for compatibility with newer versions.
How to use it

Save the content: Create a file named requirements.txt in the same directory as your Python script (Aurora.Py). Paste the code above into this file.

Install dependencies: Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved requirements.txt, and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt 

Or you may open a Command prompt as administrator and type these commands "pip install Discord" "pip install Colorama"
